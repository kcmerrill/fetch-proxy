Fetch is a simple proxy that automagically routes web traffic to running docker containers to host ports. Great for dev/ci environments. Works great in production for hosts that have web sites running on one machine.

 * Healthchecks for services
 * Secure connections using lets encrypt
 * Default service if mapping not found
 * Response timeouts
 * Automagically maps new containers
 * Works using localhost for dev environments

Use the `--insecure` flag if you are working on localhost, else enjoy `https://` urls from letsencrypt.org
